# ScheduleHTMLtoCSV

Goal: Automate the creation of weekly calendar updates for my HEB schedule.


Outcome: Partial automation of weekly updates. The Salesforce website is difficult to scrape and Google Calendar API has restrictions. I used Python to read the HTML copied to clipboard to create the desired output which can be uploaded to Google Calendar.
